Intelligent ETL Solution Industrialization or IESI is a MIT licensed automation framework to automate end-to-end delivery and testing processes for data driven initiatives (integration or migration). 
It allows the configuration, execution and reporting on automated executions driving development, testing and deployment automation. 
Although our name includes the term ETL, the framework is so much more. 
Read this term from its conceptual essence: extract, transform, load or rather input, process, output. 
So, this applies to all types of systems and processes, from backend to data platforms and connectivity.

See the [homepage](https://metadew.github.io/iesi/index.html) for more information.
