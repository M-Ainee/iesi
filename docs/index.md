# Our framework

**Automation for everyone.** Our vision is that automation should be easy; our mission that it should be available to everyone. Whether you are working in a small company or a large one, working on a small project or automating end-to-end processes across an entire organization, working from your laptop or running your infrastructure in the cloud; you should be able to leverage our framework to be up and running very fast.

> Our objective is to be up and running in less than 1 hour

Intelligent ETL Solution Industrialization or **IESI** is an automation framework orgininally created at Accenture to automate end-to-end delivery and testing processes for data driven initiatives (integration or migration). It allows the configuration, execution and reporting on automated executions driving development, testing and deployment automation. Although our name includes the term *ETL*, the framework is so much more. Read this term from its conceptual essence: extract, transform, load or rather input, process, output. So, this applies to all types of systems and processes, from backend to data platforms and connectivity.

> It becomes easier to automate than to do it manually

Our framework aims to differientiate itself by making automation services accessible and affordable for any project or organization.

|Fast install|Zero-touch on-premise (Cloud containers coming soon)|
|Broad access|Get ROI for small and large projects or organizations|
|Easy to use|Reusable configuration making automation faster|
|Agnostic|Technology, vendor and industry agnostic|

> Test automation (and data-driven automation in general) should not be considered a commodity but will provide many ways of differentiation in the future

IESI was designed primarily with configuration and reuse in mind. 
It has been used at several projects and clients over the past years and evolves along with these initiatives. 
Please consider that we are aware of some shortcomings but many efforts are undertaken to improve features and documentation. 
In the meantime, feel free to download and experiment with the automation framework and get acquainted with our approach. 
[We welcome contributors](/{{site.repository}}/pages/contribute/contribute.html) from any organization or background to help us grow the framework.

> We grow our framework best when we combine innovation with real life experiences and common sense
